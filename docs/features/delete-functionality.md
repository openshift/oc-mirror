# Image Delete Functionality in V2


## Overview

In V1, pruning (or deletion of images) is set automatically, if a specific index (release, catalog) or additionalImage
is to be deleted, the current workflow would be to use the same "StorageConfig" setting and omit  the previously mirrored images, the pruning logic will find the "difference"
and prune the images accordingly.

This has its pros and cons, but due to the large amount of bugs been filed, we decided to change the behaviour in v2.

In v2 a new kind called "DeleteImageSetConfiguration" has been introduced, this is used to configure the deletion of images, to avoid using 
an ImageSetConfig, accidentally deleting wanted (deployed) images.

A new oc-mirror delete sub command is now available to execute the delete workflow with the DeleteImageSetConfiguration input.

This functionality is able to work in a complete "air-gapped" (disconnected) environment, provided that the images have been
previously mirrored (i.e the local cache and remote registry know about the images being deleted).

The delete functionality is split into 2 stages:

- The first stage is to create (generate) a delete yaml file using the --generate flag, this file is used to validate the images/blobs that will be deleted.
- The second stage is to use the delete yaml file (once validated) to actually perform a local cache and remote registry delete.


## Usage

Here is an example of the DeleteImageSetConfig:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DeleteImageSetConfiguration
delete:
  platform:
    channels:
      - name: stable-4.13 
        minVersion: 4.13.3
        maxVersion: 4.13.3
  operators:
    - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.12
      packages:
      - name: aws-load-balancer-operator
  additionalImages: 
    - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi@sha256:bce7e9f69fb7d4533447232478fd825811c760288f87a35699f9c8f030f2c1a6
    - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi-minimal@sha256:8bedbe742f140108897fb3532068e8316900d9814f399d676ac78b46e740e34e
```

Its immediately obvious that "kind" and "mirror" fields have changed compared to the ImageSetConfig, this is to ensure
that all the relevant filtering and validation are done correctly, without having to update the internal code drastically.

The "delete" entry is the main entry, it contains the "platform", "operators" and "additionalImages" entries, these are used to filter the images
to intentionally delete these images.

### Command line examples

```bash

# stage 1
# -------

# use the --generate flag for stage 1
# --config and --workspace are mandatory
# --delete-id is optional

# create delete yaml file for delete phase using --generate
oc-mirror delete --config delete-image-set-config.yaml --workspace file://<previously-mirrored-work-folder> --v2 --generate docker://<remote-registry> 

# use --delete-id (to compare versions)
oc-mirror delete --config delete-image-set-config.yaml --workspace file://<previously-mirrored-work-folder> --v2 --generate --delete-id v4.11 docker://<remote-registry> 


# stage 2
# -------

# omit the flag --generate
# --delete-yaml-file for stage 2 is mandatory
# --force-cache-delete is optional (default false)

# once the generate stage has executed successfully use the created delete yaml to delete the images from the remote registry
# default setting for the delete-yaml-file is <previously-mirrored-work-folder>/delete/delete-images.yaml
# delete remote registry only 
oc-mirror delete --v2 --delete-yaml-file <previously-mirrored-work-folder>/delete/delete-images-v4.11.yaml docker://<remote-registry> 

# delete remote registry and force cache delete 
oc-mirror delete --v2 --delete-yaml-file <previously-mirrored-work-folder>/delete/delete-images-v4.11.yaml --force-cache-delete true docker://<remote-registry> 

```

### Description

The --generate flag is used to create the delete yaml files in stage 1.
The file created can be found in the "previously-mirrored-work-folder/working-dir/delete/" folder 

The flag --workspace has intentionally been introduced as to avoid any similarity with the current oc-mirror workflow,
ensuring no accidental deletion of images.

The --workspace flag must have the `file://` prefix and with the path to the previously mirrored images, this flag is mandatory when used with the --generate flag.

The --delete-id flag is used to create files in the delete folder with an id, it is optional when using the --generate flag.

The delete command line has to point to the remote registry from which to delete images (generally the final argument of the command). This argument is mandatory for both stages, generate and delete. It must have a `docker://` prefix.

**NB**
The --force-cache-delete flag will delete the local cache. Before deleting the local cache , we recommend storing all previously mirrored tar.gz files (i.e s3 bucket as an example) for recovery.
Also note that no check is made to delete any dependant blobs in other images, so please take care when using this flag. Its always a good policy to validate the blobs that will be deleted, before executing the actual delete.

An example of a "generated" delete yaml, (ubi8 image deletion):

```yaml

kind: DeleteImageList 
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2

**N.B.  A note about the remote registry deletion, only manifests are deleted (no blobs), it's out of scope for oc-mirror
to make an informed decision about deleting blobs on the remote-registry due to potential impact on dependencies etc.
The task of removing blobs for a remote registry will be left to the system administrator.**

**N.B.  A note about local cache delete. If at all possible try not delete the local cache, however if at the last resort disk
space becomes a problem, please verify all image manifests and blobs that are going to be deleted 
(refer to the delete-images-xx.yaml file that gets generated), also ensure you have all the relevant tar.gz files available (to restore cache if needed) 
before executing the local cache delete.**


### Troubleshooting and Recovery

The delete functionality is split into 2 stages (as mentioned in the overview), a typical workflow would be to use the --generate flag first, this will create the delete yaml file, this file can be used to validate the images/blobs that will be deleted.

We highly recommend making backup of each tar.gz file that gets created in the "work-directory" folder. You could also create a tar.gz using the --since flag (see the oc-mirror command help for more information).

The --delete-id flag, is used to create various files in the "working-dir/delete" folder (files created by the delete functionality) for version comparison and validation.
The file created will be used in stage 2 (actual delete of remote registry and cache).

For release image deletion it's recommended to be very specific with versions, i.e in making the minVersion and maxVersion entries the same.

For operators its recommended to also ensure specific versions, also keep in mind that if only one package in a catalog is deleted, ensure that the actual catalog index is not deleted.

If by accident the local cache is deleted, untar all the relevant <work-directory>/mirror-xxxx-sequence.tar.gz files and copy the docker contents to the local cache directory
(default is ~/.oc-mirror/.cache), the local cache directory can be configured using the envar "OC_MIRROR_CACHE" or the
--cache-dir command line flag.

If the remote registry is also deleted by accident, re-run the oc-mirror command using the --from flag (disk to mirror mode, it will use the contents of all the relevant .tar.gz files), this will ensure your remote registry is back to the original state.
