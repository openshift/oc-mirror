# This config demonstrates how to mirror a single operator. By
# specifying a startingVersion, that version and every version to the
# specified channel's latest (HEAD) version will be mirrored. 

# If a package is specified with no startingVersion or channel, all
# versions within every channel of the specified package will be mirrored.

# Alternatively, omit the channel and leave the startingVersion and all 
# higher versions within every channel the startingVersion exists within 
# the specified package will be mirrored.
