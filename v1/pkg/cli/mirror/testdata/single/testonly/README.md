# NOTICE

This folder contains all of the information needed to create a dummy OCI layout in the directory called "layout".
This OCI layout can only be used for test case purposes. The single image is built 
off of scratch in order to minimize its size. While this image contains a declarative config, it is NOT a 
deployable catalog since it does not contain real executables nor does it contain any libraries that 
would normally be necessary to support an executable. In other words, this image WILL NOT RUN.
