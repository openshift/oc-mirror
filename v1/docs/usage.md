## Overview

**Notice:** These commands are early alpha and may change significantly between application versions. 

## Prerequisites
> **WARNING**: Depending on the configuration file used and the periodicity between running `oc-mirror`, this process may download multiple hundreds of gigabytes of data, though differential updates should usually result in significantly smaller Imagesets.
### Authentication: 
oc-mirror currently retrieves registry credentials from `~/.docker/config.json` or `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`. Make sure that your [Red Hat OpenShift Pull Secret](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) and any other needed registry credentials are populated in the credentials file.

### Certificate Trust

oc-mirror currently references the host system for certificate trust information. For now, you must [add all certificates (trust chain) to be trusted to the System-Wide Trust Store](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/sec-shared-system-certificates)

## Basic Usage

### oc-mirror vs oc mirror

There are two ways to use oc-mirror, either standalone or part of the oc plugin eco system. More information can be found https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/augmenting-openshift-cli-with-plugins.

In short:
- To use `oc-mirror` build this repo and use the binary produced. 
- To use `oc mirror` build this repo and move the binary into a directory on the PATH.


## Create an initial oc-mirror imageset configuration

```sh
oc-mirror init
```

### Content Discovery

oc-mirror provides a way to discover OpenShift release and operator content,
then use that information to craft mirror payloads. The `list updates` command traverses update graphs
between the last `oc mirror` run and provided configuration to show what new versions are available.

#### Updates

- List updates since the last `oc-mirror` run
  ```sh
  oc-mirror list updates --config imageset-config.yaml
  ```
**Note:** You must have existing metadata in your workspace (or remote storage, if using) to use `list updates`
#### Releases
1. List all available release payloads for a version of OpenShift in the stable channel (the default channel)
   ```sh
   oc-mirror list releases --version=4.9
   ```
2. List all available release channels to query for a version of OpenShift
   ```sh
   oc-mirror list releases --channels --version=4.9
   ```
3. List all available release payloads for a version of OpenShift in a specific channel
   ```sh
   oc-mirror list releases --channel=fast-4.9
   ```
#### Operators
1. List all available Operator catalogs for a version of OpenShift
   ```sh
   oc-mirror list operators --catalogs --version=4.9
   ```
2. List all available Operator packages in a catalog
   ```sh
   oc-mirror list operators --catalog=registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.9
   ````
3. List all available Operator channels in a package
    ```sh
    oc-mirror list operators --catalog=registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.9 --package=kiali
    ```
4. List all available Operator versions in a channel
      ```sh
    oc-mirror list operators --catalog=registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.9 --package=kiali --channel=stable
    ```
### Mirroring
#### Fully Disconnected
- Create then publish to your mirror registry:
    ```sh
    oc-mirror --config imageset-config.yaml file://archives
    oc-mirror --from /path/to/archives docker://reg.mirror.com
    ```
#### Partially Disconnected
- Publish mirror to mirror
     ```sh
    oc-mirror --config imageset-config.yaml docker://localhost:5000
    ```

#### Fully disconnected Enclaves

See [Enclave Support](../v2/docs/enclave_support.md)

### Additional Features
- Get information on your imageset using `describe`
    ```sh
    oc-mirror describe /path/to/archives
    ```

## Mirroring Process

During the create phase, a declarative configuration is referenced to download container images. Depending on the state of the workspace, the behavior of `create` will either package all downloaded images into an imageset or only the missing artifacts needed in the target environment will be packaged into an imageset.

> **Deep Dive:** The mirroring process assigns a UUID to the created workspace (either local or remote), which is used to track instances of metadata. Another assigned value is the sequence number. This value is assigned to each imageset to ensure the contents are publish in order. Both of these values are stored in the produced metadata file.

### Running `oc-mirror` For First Time
To create a new full imageset, use the following command with the target directory being a new, empty location and the configuration file authored referencing the config spec for the version of oc-mirror:

`oc-mirror --config imageset-config.yaml file://archives`


> **WARNING**: Depending on the configuration file used, this process may download multiple hundreds of gigabytes of data. This may take quite a while. Use the optional `-v` command line flag for more verbose output to track command execution.

**Note:** After `oc-mirror` has finished, an imageset named mirror_seq1_000000.tar will have been created and available in your specified directory. Use this file with `oc-mirror` to mirror the imageset to a disconnected registry:

`oc-mirror --from archives docker://localhost:5000`

- With a defined top-level namespace:  
`oc-mirror --from archives docker://localhost:5000/mynamespace`

### Running `oc-mirror` For Differential Updates

Once a full imageset has been created and published, differential imagesets that contain only updated images as per the configuration file can be generated with the same command as above:

`oc-mirror --config imageset-config.yaml file://archives`

## Notes about flag usage

1. The `max-per-registry` flag will control the number of concurrent request per registry. Setting this value can allow for faster image download speeds. The default is 6.
2. The `skip-missing` flag can be used to continue the mirroring process in the event that an image does not exist.
3. Certain errors (e.g. invalid images digest or tags) can by bypassed with `--continue-on-error`. Use this flag will return an exit code of
1, but the `oc-mirror` operations will continue.
3. The `skip-cleanup` flag can be used to keep the workspace from being deleted after mirroring operations.
> WARNING: Running oc-mirror against a workspace that has not been cleaned can result in unexpected behavior.

## ImageSet Configuration
The imageset configuration is intended to reflect the current state of the registry mirroring. Any content types or images that are added to the 
configuration will be added to the mirror and this is also applies to content types that are removed from the imageset configuration. Image pruning is done on a best-effort basis. `oc-mirror` will attempt image deletion and if a registry does not allow for this type of request,`oc-mirror` will return an error. the `--continue-on-error` flag can be used if desired to ignore pruning errors if the registry does not allow DELETE operations. If you are using the heads-only workflow option, `oc-mirror` will store starting versions from the initial run in the metadata and using this to maintain ranges.

An example workflow is below:

- Generate the initial configuration.
    ```sh
      apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
      kind: ImageSetConfiguration
      storageConfig:
        local:
          path: metadata
      mirror:
        additionalimages:
          - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi7/ubi:latest
    ```
- Run first `oc-mirror` operation.
- Generate a configuration for a differential run. 
    ```sh
      apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
      kind: ImageSetConfiguration
      storageConfig:
        local:
          path: metadata
      mirror:
        additionalimages:
          - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest
    ```
- Run `oc-mirror` again.

- The result on the second run of `oc-mirror` is that the `ubi8` image would be mirrored and the `ubi7` image would be removed. To keep the `ubi7` image, the configuration would be altered to the below configuration.
    ```sh
      apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
      kind: ImageSetConfiguration
      storageConfig:
        local:
          path: metadata
      mirror:
        additionalimages:
          - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi7/ubi:latest
          - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest
    ```
