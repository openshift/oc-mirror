# This config demonstrates the use of `targetCatalog` and `targetTag` for operator catalogs 
# in oder to mirror the catalog image to a different location on the target registry.

# IMPORTANT: In `targetCatalog`, the user may set as many path-components as needed,
# ending with the image repository.

# To mirror the catalog to `registry.example.com/my-org/vendors/redhat-operator-index:v4.13.0`, 
# use the below ImageSetConfig with the following command:
# $ oc mirror -c ./ImageSetConfiguration.yml docker://registry.example.com/my-org
