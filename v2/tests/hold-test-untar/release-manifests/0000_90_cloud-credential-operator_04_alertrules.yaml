        description: The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) has detected one or more stale CredentialsRequest CRs that need to be manually deleted. When the CCO is in Manual credentials mode, it will not automatially clean up stale CredentialsRequest CRs (that may no longer be necessary in the present version of OpenShift because it could involve needing to clean up manually created cloud resources. Check the conditions of all CredentialsRequests with 'oc get credentialsrequest -A' to find any CredentialsRequest(s) with a .status.condition showing a condition type of StaleCredentials set to True. Determine the appropriate steps to clean up/deprovision any previously provisioned cloud resources. Finally, delete the CredentialsRequest with an 'oc delete'.
