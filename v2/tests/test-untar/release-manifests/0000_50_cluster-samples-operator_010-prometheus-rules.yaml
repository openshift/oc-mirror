        description: |
          Samples operator is detecting problems with imagestream image imports, and the periodic retries of those
          imports are not occurring.  Contact support.  You can look at the "openshift-samples" ClusterOperator object
          for details. Most likely there are issues with the external image registry hosting the images that need to
          be investigated.  The list of ImageStreams that have failing imports are:
          {{ range query "openshift_samples_failed_imagestream_import_info > 0" }}
            {{ .Labels.name }}
          {{ end }}
          However, the list of ImageStreams for which samples operator is retrying imports is:

        summary: Samples operator is not able to access the registry on boot
        description: |
          One of two situations has occurred.  Either
          samples operator could not access 'registry.redhat.io' during its initial installation and it bootstrapped as removed.
          If this is expected, and stems from installing in a restricted network environment, please note that if you
          plan on mirroring images associated with sample imagestreams into a registry available in your restricted
          network environment, and subsequently moving samples operator back to 'Managed' state, a list of the images
          associated with each image stream tag from the samples catalog is
          provided in the 'imagestreamtag-to-image' config map in the 'openshift-cluster-samples-operator' namespace to
          assist the mirroring process.
          Or, the use of allowed registries or blocked registries with global imagestream configuration will not allow
          samples operator to create imagestreams using the default image registry 'registry.redhat.io'.
